# [v1.2.1] ATPXMLConverter (2022-07-08)

## **Changes**

- ### Added auto-complete list for function definition database search bar

## **Bug Fixes**

- ### Removed warning prompt for empty rows in config excel.

  - Empty rows that were previously filled then cleared of data are known to raise empty field warnings for every field in the row.
  - No longer raise any warnings for completely empty rows detected in the config excel file.

- ### Deleting a function library from the function definition database

  - After deleting a function library and its underlying functions, they still remain searchable from the search bar, if clicked will cause the program to exit.
  - Deleted function library and functions will no longer be searchable once deleted.
